## Analytics

<p class="lead">
What were students studying the night before the exam. Which resources did students use, and which did they roundly ignore? How do you track when students have used something that's outside your CMS? Impressory's analytics helps solve all these and more.
</p>


### Basic data collection

The analytics collected by Impressory try to work out what content was useful and what wasn't. At a basic level, Impressory tracks when content is viewed, including aggregating the data by topic, noun (video, lecture, etc), kind (YouTube, Google Slides, etc), the student's login and the student's session.  It will be possible for students to opt in or out of this analytics tracking.


### Content-specific data collection

Additionally, some content items will do some additional analytics:

* Polls will track when they were answered.

* Videos will track skip-aheads, rewinds, etc.


### Text analytics

The chat stream, comments, and text polls are prime candidates for text analytics.
