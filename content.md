## Content 

<p class="lead">
There are many different kinds of content entry that Impressory supports: Markdown pages, polls, web pages, YouTube videos, Google Slides, and more being added all the time.
</p>


### Tagging and navigation

When you add content to Impressory, you are encouraged to give it a topic. This helps, for instance, navigate from the presentation on version control, to the video, to the interactive exercise.  The tagging format for impressory is *`noun` about `topic`*.  Content can have more than one topic, and it can have more than one noun.  Often, the noun will already have been added for you -- Impressory knows for instance that YouTube videos are videos.

You can also (optionally) add adjectives.  So you can have the Keynesian view of recession as well as the monetarist view of recession. Usually you won't need that though &mdash; it's for a feature we're planning on adding down the track.

Impressory automatically keeps some other information about content.  For instance who added it, so that students can quickly find the content that was added by the teaching staff rather than by other students.

Tags also feed into [analytics](analytics.html) -- letting you gain an insight, for instance, into which topics your students were spending the most time on and when.

Shortly, tags will also be useful when writing Wiki pages.  For instance, you'll be able to quickly include all a list of all the Lectures using `@list{noun=Lecture}`



### Wiki pages (Markdown)

Wiki pages in Impressory use "Markdown" notation.  This is a popular and simple notation.




### Video

Video is supported through YouTube.  Just paste the YouTube URL or embed code into the "share something" box on the newsfeed, or add it from the [viewer](viewer.html).

Video renders both in the viewer and in the newsfeed.

This also means you can use Impressory to add interaction around a live broadcast. Embed the YouTube URL of a Google Hangout to broadcast the video, and use the chat stream (including [polls](polls.html) and all the other goodies) to interact with your online audience.


### Embed the Web

Web pages (including all those online interactive exercises that are out there) can be added as content. 


<h3>Presentations</h3>

<p>
Presentations are supported through Google Slides.  Shortly we'll also add support for presentations written locally, using Reveal.js.

<h3>Content sequences</h3>

<p>
During a lecture, you might want to progress seemlessly from one piece of content to another.  For instance, if you have a couple of presentations you want to queue after each other.  Content sequences allow you to do this.

Sometimes, you have the same content in different forms.  For instance, you may have a lecture video, the slides to go with that lecture, and a set of
