## Identities

<p class="lead">
As well as being open source, Impressory tries to be open about working with other systems rather than trying to own everything itself. This extends all the way to logging in &mdash; Impresssory is quite happy with the idea that you might want to log in directly from your CMS (Moodle, Blackboard), or use some other identity service (Twitter, GitHub account, etc) rather than using a username and password
</p>

<div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide">
  <!-- Indicators -->
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
  </ol>

  <!-- Wrapper for slides -->
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="item active">
      <div class="screenshot-big">
        <img src="images/screenshots/about_you.png" alt="Account page" class="screenshot-big">
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-caption">An account page, listing identities that can be used to sign in</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Controls -->
  <a class="left carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="icon-prev"></span>
  </a>
  <a class="right carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide="next">
    <span class="icon-next"></span>
  </a>
</div>

### Identities versus Social network integration

Just because you log in with Twitter doesn't mean you necessarily want Impressory posting to Twitter for you.


### Twitter


### GitHub


### LTI (Blackboard, Moodle)
